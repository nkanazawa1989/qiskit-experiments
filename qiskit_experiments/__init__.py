.. currentmodule:: qiskit_experiments

*Note: This package is still under active development, there will be breaking
API changes, and re-organization of the package layout.*


Experiment Data Classes
=======================

These container classes store the data and results from running experiments

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../stubs/

    ExperimentData
    AnalysisResult


Experiment Base Classes
=======================

Construction of custom experiments should be done by making subclasses of the following
base classes

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../stubs/

    BaseExperiment
    BaseAnalysis
