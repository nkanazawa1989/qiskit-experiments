    New Curve Analysis options `average_method` has been added. This option
    modifies an averaging technique for y values over the same x values.
    Defaults to `sample` for the RB experiments and `shots_weighted` for the rest of analysis.
    Previously the setup was hardcoded in the ``_format_data`` method of the analysis class,
    and no statistical difference has been introduced with introduction of this option.
