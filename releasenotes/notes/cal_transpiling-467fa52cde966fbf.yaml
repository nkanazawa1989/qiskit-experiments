upgrade:
  - |
    The transpilation in the calibration experiments has been upgraded. Indeed,
    calibration experiments define a carefully chosen set of gates and pulses
    that the transpiler should not modify. If these gates are modified by
    transpilation the results may be unusable. :class:`.BaseCalibrationExperiment`
    now defines its own transpilation to ensure a proper execution of the
    experiments. Transpile options are no-longer needed for calibration
    experiments.
